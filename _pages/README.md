# Pages of KnoxDevs Website

This folder contains the markdown files used for each page. These markdown files also contain a mix of `html` and `liquid` tags to acheive the customization desired (mainly for the cards). This website has four (plus the home page which is at the top-level `index.md`). This may change as new features / or new decisions are implemented.

Note the `liquid` tags that are used in each `.md` file. This loops through all of the `.yml` files in the `_data` folder, so if you're just wanting to add your data, check that folder's README instead of changing these pages.
