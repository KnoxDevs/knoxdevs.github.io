### Our Pledge
KnoxDevs is dedicated to providing an outstanding experience, to increase learning opportunities for all our members, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual identity, or sexual orientation.

We do not tolerate harassment of members in any form, and we would like to take this opportunity to remind all members that KnoxDevs was founded on: passionate, but respectful dialog between our members, for our members. Please treat your fellow members with respect!

Harassment<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup> is not appropriate for any group venue. Group members violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the group, at the discretion of the group organizers.

Members must remember that KnoxDevs organizers and volunteers are not trained conflict resolution specialists, nor are they security or law enforcement. KnoxDevs organizers and volunteers will immediately escalate issues around safety, violence, or similar situations to the Knoxville Police Department.

For the protection of both members and our organization, KnoxDevs will never put its organizers or volunteers in the position of trying to assess whether or not an incident merits reporting. If there is any doubt, we will report incidents to the Knoxville Police Department immediately.

### Hiring

KnoxDevs is not a marketplace. You may not solicit members who you do not personally know outside of Slack in direct messages ("DMs") for potential contract/hiring purposes. We have a `hiring` channel for the explicit purpose to help people _in the Knoxville, TN region_ find local people to hire and for local people to get hired. Hiring posts outside of this channel should be avoided, but we'll guide you to the `hiring` channel in those instances. Companies located outside of the Knoxville, TN region (legally defined as the Knoxville Metropolitan Statistical Area) will not be permitted to post in our `hiring` channel; however, we will allow instances where the post is for a remote position and the company currently employs members based in the Knoxville, TN region.

### Incident Resolution
Members should follow the golden rule: “One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.” Treat other members with respect. Simple disagreements should be resolved between the individuals concerned. Harassment or more serious issues should be escalated to a KnoxDevs organizer. That organizer will immediately contact a KnoxDevs Board member who has the responsibility to assist in resolution.
