## [0.3.0]

** Implemented enhancements:**

- Removed Companies from the `_data` folder, something that could be revisited later. Hard part is deciding \*who\* should be listed, fairness between companies large and small. Who decides how much of a _developer_ company a particular company is?
- Merged Organizations, Conferences Coworking Spaces, (newly added) Event Spaces, under `Resources` tab to also remove clutter in top level navigation.
