# Images for the Website

This subfolder is organized in a (hopefully) logical way, that mirrors the `_data` folder substructure. It's where you'll upload your photos that will go along with the data files that you edit. Each category under data has a corresponding folder here to upload images too. We also have logos for our sponsors and icons here as well.

Why upload images? Rather than send multiple sources of data to a user's browser, which potentially could be over `http://`, this ensures us that the images we serve on the website are 1) always there 2) the image it's supposed to be!
