# Template for Conferences

Below is a template you can use to add your conference to this list. Note that the file must be a YML file. We have chosen `.yml` as the extension, but `.yaml` will work as well. We probably won't accept your pull request if you do that tho ;)

Info we're looking for. You can leave any field but name and location blank if you wish.

- **Name**
- Image
- Online links, website and/or twitter
- **Location**
- Blurb, capped at 50 words (forreal)

````yaml
