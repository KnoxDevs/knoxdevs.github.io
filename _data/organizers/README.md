# Template for Organizers

Below is a template you can use to add your name as an organizer to this list. Note that the file must be a YML file. We have chosen `.yml` as the extension, but `.yaml` will work as well. We probably won't accept your pull request if you do that tho ;)

Info we're looking for. You can leave any field but name and group blank if you wish.

- **Name**
- **Group(s)** that you organize
- Image
- Online links, website and/or twitter
- Blurb, capped at 50 words (forreal)

````yaml
name: #Your name, silly.
group: # This can be singular or an array
    - 
    - 
    - 
image: #Boom! headshot. Upload into assets/images/organizers
online: #Online links
    website: 
    twitter:  
blurb: > # if you use 1 line, use a `>`, if you multiple lines, use a `|` here, then ensure that you indent! good yaml syntax.
