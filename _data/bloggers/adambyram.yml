    My name is Adam Byram. I’m a software developer in Oak Ridge, TN.
    I’ve been developing software professionally for over twelve years. I’ve worked for huge corporations on billion dollar brands, on rocket ships at cutting edge startups, and many places in between. I was also a board member/organizer for 2014 & 2015 CodeStock Conference.
