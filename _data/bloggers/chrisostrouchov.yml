  Hi I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Tennessee. I
  am passionate about scientific computing and developing software
  that enables scientists. You will find on my blog that enjoy talking
  about Python, numerical computing, data science, and some devops
  with Kubernetes, Docker, and Ceph.
