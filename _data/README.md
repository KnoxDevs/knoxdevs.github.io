# KnoxDevs Directory

This repository contains a collection of `.yml` files that make up the bulk of our website and our soon to be release API for all information about KnoxDevs groups. They are files that contain basic information about each group, blogger, conference, organization, organizer, coworking spot, or event space that gives visitors to the KnoxDevs website and potential future apps, valuable tidbits that hopefully help to strengthen the community.

The structure of this repo is like so:

```
